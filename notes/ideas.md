# ideas

Basically TODOs, but more aspirational.

- Dev stuff
  - depend on bread
  - add word wrapping library
  - add console table library
  - add help printing librarby
  - add CLI using the console/help libraries
- AOC Stuff
  - Go through AOC 2020 and list out things that would be helpful
  - ...then add them here!
  - ...then test on AOC 2015 or something.
